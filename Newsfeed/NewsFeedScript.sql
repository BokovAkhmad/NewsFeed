These schools promote a strong connection to African heritage, and an Afrocentric lifestyle; we regularly celebrated important African American people and I learned a lot about my history as an African American. As I grew older, I realized that the black people that came before us have made us into what we are today. So of course I had to include them in my doodle on the theme ?What makes me...me.?\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My goal with my art was to not only turn heads but souls as well?not only for someone to see it and be amazed by it but also to have them understand and connect with it. My drawing explores childhood themes and then moves into reflections on our society. Everything surrounding the word \"Google\" depicts my characteristics. Of all the things I chose to include, the six most special to me are the Symbol of Life (the ankh), the African continent, where everything began for me and my ancestors, the Eye of Horus, the word \"power\" drawn in black, the woman\'s fist based on one of my favorite artist?s works, and the D.C. flag?because I?m a Washingtonian at heart and I love my city with everything in me!\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I\'ve always been encouraged to pursue art, especially by my teachers?first Baba Camera from Roots, and now my art teacher Zalika Perkins. But participating in Doodle 4 Google gave me an understanding of why art matters and why MY art matters?because it speaks to people. No matter our differences, everyone is touched by art in some way.

This disruption is driven, in part, by the intersection of three trends: a massive explosion of data, intelligence from machine learning and advanced analytics, and the economics and agility of cloud computing.\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While databases power nearly every aspect of business today, they were not originally designed with this disruption in mind. Traditional databases were about recording and retrieving transactions such as orders and payments very reliably, very securely and efficiently. They were designed to enable reliable, secure, mission-critical transactional applications at small to medium scale, in on-premises datacenters.\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Databases built to get ahead of todays disruptions do very fast analyses of live data in-memory as transactions are being recorded or queried. They support very low latency advanced analytics and machine learning, such as forecasting and predictive models, on the same data, so that applications can easily embed data-driven intelligence. They allow databases to be offered as a fully managed service in the cloud, in turn making it easy to build and deploy intelligent Software as a Service (SaaS) apps.\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also provide innovative security features built for a world where a majority of data is accessible over the Internet. They support 247 high-availability, efficient management and database administration across platforms. They therefore enable mission critical intelligent applications to be built and managed both in the cloud and on-premises. They are exciting harbingers of a new world of ambient intelligence.\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We built SQL Server 2016 for this new world, and to help businesses get ahead of todays disruptions. It supports hybrid transactional/analytical processing, advanced analytics and machine learning, mobile BI, data integration, always encrypted query processing capabilities and in-memory transactions with persistence. It is also perhaps the worlds only relational database to be born cloud-first, with the majority of features first deployed and tested in Azure, across 22 global datacenters and billions of requests per day. It is customer tested and battle ready.\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share with you what industry analysts and our customers think.\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industry analysts recognize the breadth and depth of our capabilities in data, intelligence and the cloud. Microsoft is the only company recognized as a leader across data platforms and cloud by Gartner in both vision and execution, in database, business intelligence, advanced analytics, data warehouse, cloud infrastructure and cloud application platforms.\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The customers weve been working with in preview share our excitement and are already benefiting from new innovations, such as built-in analytics.','SQL Server 2016',10),(371,'2016-03-31 23:55:23','  Its been an incredible year for the data business at Microsoft and an incredible year for data across the industry. This Thursday at our Data Driven event in New York, we will kick off a wave of launch activities for SQL Server 2016 with general availability later this year. This is the most significant release of SQL Server that we have ever done, and brings with it some fantastic new capabilities. SQL Server 2016 delivers:\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Groundbreaking security encryption capabilities that enable data to always be encrypted at rest, in motion and in-memory to deliver maximum security protection\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-In-memory database support for every workload with performance increases up to 30-100x\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Incredible Data Warehousing performance with the #1, #2 and #3 TPC-H 10 Terabyte benchmarks for non-clustered performance, and as of March 7, the #1 SAP SD Two-Tier performance benchmark on Windows1\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Business Intelligence for every employee on every device  including new mobile BI support for iOS, Android and Windows Phone devices\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Advanced analytics using our new R support that enables customers to do real-time predictive analytics on both operational and analytic data\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Unique cloud capabilities that enable customers to deploy hybrid architectures that partition data workloads across on-premises and cloud based systems to save costs and increase agility\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These improvements, and many more, are all built into SQL Server and bring you not just a new database but a complete platform for data management, business analytics and intelligent apps  one that can be used in a consistent way across both on-premises and the cloud. In fact, over the last year weve been using the SQL Server 2016 code-base to run in production more than 1.4 million SQL Databases in the cloud using our Azure SQL Database as a Service offering, and this real-world experience has made SQL Server 2016 an incredibly robust and battle-hardened data platform.\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gartner recently named Microsoft as leading the industry in their Magic Quadrant for Operational Database Management Systems in both execution and vision.

We are deeply sorry for the unintended offensive and hurtful tweets from Tay, which do not represent who we are or what we stand for, nor how we designed Tay. Tay is now offline and we?ll look to bring Tay back only when we are confident we can better anticipate malicious intent that conflicts with our principles and values.\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to share what we learned and how we?re taking these lessons forward.\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For context, Tay was not the first artificial intelligence application we released into the online social world. In China, our XiaoIce chatbot is being used by some 40 million people, delighting with its stories and conversations. The great experience with XiaoIce led us to wonder: Would an AI like this be just as captivating in a radically different cultural environment? Tay ? a chatbot created for 18- to 24- year-olds in the U.S. for entertainment purposes ? is our first attempt to answer this question.\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we developed Tay, we planned and implemented a lot of filtering and conducted extensive user studies with diverse user groups. We stress-tested Tay under a variety of conditions, specifically to make interacting with Tay a positive experience. Once we got comfortable with how Tay was interacting with users, we wanted to invite a broader group of people to engage with her. It?s through increased interaction where we expected to learn more and for the AI to get better and better.\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The logical place for us to engage with a massive group of users was Twitter. Unfortunately, in the first 24 hours of coming online, a coordinated attack by a subset of people exploited a vulnerability in Tay. Although we had prepared for many types of abuses of the system, we had made a critical oversight for this specific attack. As a result, Tay tweeted wildly inappropriate and reprehensible words and images. We take full responsibility for not seeing this possibility ahead of time. We will take this lesson forward as well as those from our experiences in China, Japan and the U.S. Right now, we are hard at work addressing the specific vulnerability that was exposed by the attack on Tay.\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, we face some difficult ? and yet exciting ? research challenges in AI design. AI systems feed off of both positive and negative interactions with people. In that sense, the challenges are just as much social as they are technical. We will do everything possible to limit technical exploits but also know we cannot fully predict all possible human interactive misuses without learning from mistakes. To do AI right, one needs to iterate with many people and often in public forums. We must enter each one with great caution and ultimately learn and improve, step by step, and to do this without offending people in the process. We will remain steadfast in our efforts to learn from this and other experiences as we work toward contributing to an Internet that represents the best, not the worst, of humanity.','Learning from Tay\'s introduction',10),(373,'2016-03-31 23:58:05','  Kyle Schwaneke\'s bank account was approaching empty.\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He\'d been unemployed for a year and a half, since the indie game studio he\'d been working for shut its doors.

Last week, we laser-focused on key individual and cultural attributes that foster an environment of 10x innovation, especially within a large and established company like Cisco.

Definitely not, when one door closes a few others open. Lets explore some of those opening doors.\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The landscape of the Oil & Gas market is traditionally categorized in three areas:\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Upstream  exploration, development, and production of O&G\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Midstream  the storage and transportation of O&G\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Downstream  processing and selling the final products\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that with the current low oil price, only those oilfields where the oil can be extracted for less cost per barrel than the current selling price are still financially attractive to explore.\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upstream is a difficult place to be at this moment. Nobody wants to be the first to stop producing because others will take over your market share. Oilfields will keep producing and store the oil or take the loss for a relative short time. This leads to the current overproduction of crude oil.\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the current oil price, upstream companies would be wise to not sell more crude oil (unless it serves a strategic goal) since this can cause a further price drop.\r<br/>\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upstream O&G companies should focus on cost reduction in the current economic climate.','Falling Oil Prices',11),(376,'2016-04-01 00:01:51','\r<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great leaders inspire us.
